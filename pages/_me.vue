      <h1>Kazuyoshi Kato / 加藤 和良</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a software developer, Japanese and Seattle transplant.
      </p>

      <p>
        I work as a Software Development Engineer at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon.com</a>.
        I joined Amazon Japan in 2012, and moved to Seattle in 2014.
        Before Amazon, I worked for <a href="https://mixi.co.jp">Mixi</a>.
        The company is now known for mobile games, but I was working on
        its social networking service.
