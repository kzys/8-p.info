  I'm a software developer, Japanese and Seattle transplant.
</p>

<p>
  I work as a Software Development Engineer at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon.com</a>.
  I joined Amazon Japan in 2012, and moved to Seattle in 2014.
  Before Amazon, I worked for <a href="https://mixi.co.jp">Mixi</a>.
  The company is now known for mobile games, but I was working on
  its social networking service.

  <em>But</em>, all opinions expressed here are entirely my own.
