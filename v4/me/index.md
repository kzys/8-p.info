# Kazuyoshi Kato

Hello! My name is Kazuyoshi Kato. I'm a Japanese software developer in Seattle, Washington. I work for [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/).

I bought this domain, [8-p.info](https://8-p.info/) in 2003. I was a college student in Japan at that time. All cool hackers were having cool domains, so I wanted mine.

I'm @kzys on [GitHub](https://github.com/kzys/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kzys). I occasionally update [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kazuyoshi/).

## FAQ

<h3 id="kazu">Kazu? Kaz? Kato?</h3>
<p>
Kazuyoshi seems long for non-Japanese, albeit
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazuyoshi_Miura">common</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamori">name</a> in Japan.
So I often use "Kazu" instead.
Kaz is fine. It may be closer to the pronunciation.
Kato is okay, but that's my family name.

My name, in Kanji is 加藤和良. 加藤 is my family name and 和良 is my given name.
Chinese people could recognize the letters since Kanji is derived from Chinese.
</p>
<p>
Japanese has another writing system, Hiragana.
My name in Hiragana is かとうかずよし.
Hiragana is "phonographic" whereas Kanji is "logographic".
In other words, Hiragana basically represents its pronunciation,
like the alphabet in English or Hangul in Korean.
</p>
<p>
Hiragana can be translated into the alphabet in English, since both are phonographic.
かとう is Kato. かずよし is Kazuyoshi.
The romanization system is called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepburn_romanization">Hepburn romanization</a>,
which maps Hiragana characters to English alphabets.
</p>
<p>
That may be the reason I used "Kazu" in the beginning.
I thought about the letters, rather than the pronunciation.
</p>
<p>
By the way, Japanese, as like Chinese and Korean,
write names in the <em>family name, given name</em> order.
I used to do that even in English, but now getting used to use
the <em>given name, family name</em> order, especially since I live in the States.
</p>
<p>
However, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-names/family-comes-first-japan-to-switch-order-of-names-in-victory-for-tradition-idUSKCN1VR1LE"
>the Japanese government is starting to use
the <em>family name, given name</em> order even in English</a>.
What's a mess...
