## From the internet

Inspired by [Foundations of a Tiny Directory](https://www.kickscondor.com/foundations-of-a-tiny-directory/), I'm collecting the good parts of the internet.

### Software development

* [Simple, correct, fast: in that order](https://drewdevault.com/2018/07/09/Simple-correct-fast.html) - It is really hard to do that though
* [Computers can be understood](https://blog.nelhage.com/post/computers-can-be-understood/)
* [TestDouble](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDouble.html) - Dummy objects, fake objects, stubs, spies and mocks.

### Go

* [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go)

### Laws
* [Betteridge's law of headlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines) - Any headline that ends in a question mark can be answered by the word no.
* [Cunningham's Law](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Cunningham%27s_Law) - The best way to get the right answer on the internet is not to ask a question; it's to post the wrong answer.
