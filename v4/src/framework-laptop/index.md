# Framework Laptop

[Framework](https://frame.work/) Laptop is a laptop that is repairable and upgradable.
I bought one in 2022 for personal use and installed Fedora Linux 36.
Then I bought another in 2023 for work and installed Ubuntu Desktop 22.04.

## HiDPI

Framework Linux's display is 13.5 inch and 2256 x 1504 px. The pixel density is slightly lower than Apple's similar laptops. For example, MacBook Air is 13.3 inch and 2560 x 1600 px.

For me, the following setting strikes the good balance between screen real estate and smooth text rendering.

* Settings > Displays > Scale: 100%
* Tweaks > Fonts > Scaling Factor: 1.50
* Tweaks > Fonts > All font sizes: 10
