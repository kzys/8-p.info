# containerd

containerd is a container runtime, originally written by Docker engineers.
[Solomon Hykes, the founder of Docker has blogged about it in 2016](https://www.docker.com/blog/introducing-containerd/).

> Today Docker is spinning out its core container runtime functionality into a standalone component,
> incorporating it into a separate project called containerd, and will be donating it to
> a neutral foundation early next year. This is the latest chapter in a multi-year effort to break up
> the Docker platform into a more modular architecture of loosely coupled components.

[committer since 2022](https://github.com/containerd/project/pull/84).
