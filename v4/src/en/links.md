## From the internet

Inspired by [Foundations of a Tiny Directory](https://www.kickscondor.com/foundations-of-a-tiny-directory/), I'm collecting the good parts of the internet.

### Software development

* [Simple, correct, fast: in that order](https://drewdevault.com/2018/07/09/Simple-correct-fast.html) - It is really hard to do that though
* [Computers can be understood](https://blog.nelhage.com/post/computers-can-be-understood/)
* [Error Handling in Node.js](https://www.tritondatacenter.com/node-js/production/design/errors) - Operational errors vs. programmer errors.

### Martin Fowler

* [TestDouble](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDouble.html) - Dummy objects, fake objects, stubs, spies and mocks.
* [TestCoverage](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestCoverage.html) - <q>Test coverage is a useful tool for finding untested parts of a codebase. Test coverage is of little use as a numeric statement of how good your tests are.</q>

### Go

* [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go)
* [Practical Go](https://dave.cheney.net/practical-go/presentations/gophercon-singapore-2019.html) (2019)
