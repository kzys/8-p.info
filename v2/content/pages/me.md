# Kazuyoshi Kato / 加藤 和良

Hello! My name is Kazuyoshi Kato. I'm a Japanese software developer in Seattle, Washington. I work for Amazon Web Services since July 2019.

I bought this domain, [8-p.info](https://8-p.info/) in 2003. I was a college student in Saitama at that time. All cool hackers have their cool domain, so I wanted mine.

I'm @kzys on [GitHub](https://github.com/kzys/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kzys). I occasionally update [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kazuyoshi/).
