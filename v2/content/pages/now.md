# What I'm doing right now

July 2021

- Parenting.
- I still work for Amazon. My 10th anniversary is approaching.
- Living in Seattle.
- Helping [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd). I became its reviewer in 2021.
- Maintaining [firecracker-containerd](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker-containerd) and some other AWS-owned open-source software.
- Trying to avoid Twitter and Facebook.
