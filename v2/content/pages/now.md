# What I'm doing right now

September 2021 @ Seattle

- Parenting.
- I still work for Amazon. Promoted to a *senior* software engineer finally!
- Helping [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd). I became its reviewer in 2021.
- Maintaining [firecracker-containerd](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker-containerd) and some other AWS-owned open-source software.
- I may use Twitter a bit more the rest of this year.
- I would not use Facebook still.
