I bought this domain in 2003, when I got into a college. This was the place where I used to distribute software. While all files are still there, I don't link them from here since they would not be relevant anymore.

Nowadays my updates go to my [blogs](https://blog.8-p.info/).

I'm also active on [GitHub](https://github.com/kzys/). My day job is mostly writing open source software. It is too good to be true.

Oh, let me introduce myself.
I'm <a class="h-card" class="u-url" rel="me" href="/me/">Kazuyoshi Kato</a>, a Japanese software developer in Seattle, Washington.
